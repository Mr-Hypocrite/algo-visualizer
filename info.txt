*DATA STRUCTURE: A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. 
There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. 
Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.

ADT: The functional definition of a data structure is known as ADT (Abstract Data Type) which is independent of implementation.
An ADT is a mathematical model of a data structure that specifies the type of data stored, the operations supported on them, and the types of parameters of the operations. 
An ADT specifies what each operation does, but not how it does it. Typically, an ADT can be implemented using one of many different data structures.

*CLASSIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES:

Data structures can be classified as:
a) Simple data structure b) Compound data structure 

a) Simple data structure can be constructed with the help of primitive data structure. 
A primitive data structure used to represent the standard data types of any one of the computer languages.
Variables, arrays, pointers, structures, unions, etc. are examples of primitive data structures.

b) Compound data structure can be constructed with the help of any one of the primitive data structure and it is having a specific functionality. 
It can be designed by user. It can be classified as i) Linear data structure ii) Non-linear data structure

i) Linear data structures can be constructed as a continuous arrangement of data elements in the memory. It can be constructed by using array data type.
The following list of operations applied on linear data structures 1. Add an element 2. Delete an element 
3. Traverse 4. Sort the list of elements 5. Search for a data element 
For example Stack, Queue, Tables, List, and Linked Lists.

ii) Non-linear data structure can be constructed as a collection of randomly distributed set of data item joined together by using a special pointer.
The following list of operations applied on non-linear data structures. 1. Add elements 2. Delete elements 3. Display the elements 
4. Sort the list of elements 5. Search for a data element 
For example Tree, Decision tree, Graph and Forest.

*ARRAY AS DATA STRUCTURE: An array is a linear data structure that collects elements of the same data type and stores them in contiguous and adjacent memory locations.
Applications of Array as Data Structure- i) Searching ii) Sorting iii) Matrix Operations iv) Static implmentation of Data Structres like Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph et cetera.
